# 200260031_Calculator_self-project
I have developed a simple flutter project, a mobile application using Dart programming language. It can perform all the basic algebric calculations, a Calculator can, involving two or more numbers. 
This is an attempt to learn and apply some of the most helpful widgets and flutter packages implemented using Dart programming. 
Flutter packages used are: material.dart and cupertino.dart
